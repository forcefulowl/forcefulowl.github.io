# 442. Find All Duplicats in an Array

### Description


Given an array of integers, 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements that appear twice in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime?



### Solution (使用array本身作为hash table)


```python
class Solution(object):
    def findDuplicates(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        res = []
        for x in nums:
            if nums[abs(x)-1] < 0:
                res.append(abs(x))
            else:
                
                nums[abs(x)-1] *= -1
                print(nums[abs(x)-1])
        return res
```

# 141. Linked List Cycle

### Description

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

Follow up:
Can you solve it without using extra space?

### Solution(Floyd Cycle Detection Algorithm)

```python
class ListNode(object):
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def hasCycle(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: bool
        """
        slow = fast = head
        while fast and fast.next is not None:
            fast = fast.next.next
            slow = slow.next
            if slow == fast:
                return True
        return False
```

# 557. Reverse Words in a String III

### Description

Given a string, you need to reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

### Solution
Slice notation "[a,b,c]" means "count in increments of c starting at a inclusive, up to b exclusive". If c is negative you count backwards, if omitted it is 1. If a is omitted then you start as far as possible in the direction you're counting from (so that's the start if c is positive and the end if negative). If b is omitted then you end as far as possible in the direction you're counting to (so that's the end if c is positive and the start if negative). If a or b is negative it's an offset from the end (-1 being the last character) instead of the start.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def reverseWords(self, s):

        return ' '.join(s.split()[::-1])[::-1]
```
